"""AirLabs flight-schedule lookup for delay/early calculations.

Used to obtain *scheduled* departure and arrival times that FR24's API
doesn't return. We compare AirLabs' ``arr_time_utc`` (scheduled) against
the slate's locally computed ``eta_utc`` (current estimate) to compute
"X min late / early" for the displayed flight, and use ``dep_time_utc``
to drive the "hours elapsed / hours remaining" readout.

Uses the ``/schedules`` endpoint rather than ``/flight``: ``/flight`` returns
*one* instance per callsign and frequently picks the wrong one when a flight
number is reused on the same day (e.g. Republic running DL5674 BOS-CLE in
both the morning and afternoon). ``/schedules`` returns every instance for
the day so we can disambiguate by destination and live status.

The free AirLabs tier is 1,000 calls/month, so caching is aggressive:

* Positive cache: per (callsign, dest_iata), valid for 20 hours. A given
  flight's schedule for the day doesn't change once filed; reusing the same
  callsign on a future day will refresh after the TTL expires.
* Negative cache: per (callsign, dest_iata), 1 hour. Skip non-commercial /
  unscheduled callsigns (private aircraft, military) without burning budget.
* Network errors aren't cached — retried next snapshot.

Configured by env var:
    AIRLABS_API_KEY  — your AirLabs API key (free at airlabs.co)
